	<description xml:lang="en">
		Hitori is a small logic puzzle in a similar vein to the more
		popular Sudoku. In the game, the player starts with a square
		board of numbers, and has to paint out cells until there are no
		duplicate numbers in each row and column. The following rules
		apply:
		 • There must only be one of each number in the unpainted cells
		   in each row and column.
		 • No painted cell may be adjacent to another, vertically or
		   horizontally.
		 • All the unpainted cells must be joined together vertically
		   and horizontally in one group.
		These are the only three rules of the game, and so there may
		well be multiple solutions to a Hitori puzzle board.
