	<title>Customizing the Game</title>

	<p>The game can be customized by changing the board size — boards from 5–10 cells square are allowed.</p>
	<p>To change the board size, choose an option from <guiseq><gui style="menu">Game</gui><gui style="menuitem">Board Size</gui></guiseq>.
		<app>Hitori</app> will ask if you want to stop the current game if you're in the middle of one, then start a new game with the
		requested board size.</p>
