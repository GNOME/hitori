		<!-- * the second component of the revision number is a decimal unit that is incremented with each revision of the manual. -->

			<title>Hitori the Game</title>
			<para>Hitori is a small logic puzzle in a similar vein to the more popular Sudoku. In the game, the player starts with a square board
			of numbers, and has to "paint out" cells until there are no duplicate numbers in each row and column. The following rules apply:</para>
			<itemizedlist> 
				<listitem><para>There must only be one of each number in the unpainted cells in each row and column.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>No painted cell may be adjacent to another, vertically or horizontally.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>All the unpainted cells must be joined together vertically and horizontally in one group.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>These are the only three rules of the game, and so there may be multiple solutions to a Hitori puzzle board, although it's unlikely.</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="hitori-interface">
			<title>Interface</title>
			<para>&app; has only one window; the main window, which consists of the menubar and number board, shown below.</para>
			<figure id="mainwindow-fig"> 
				<title>&app; Main Window</title> 
				<screenshot> 
					<mediaobject> 
						<imageobject><imagedata fileref="figures/hitori_main_window.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
						<textobject> 
							<phrase>Shows &app; main window, containing the number board, Game and Help menus.</phrase> 
						</textobject> 
					</mediaobject> 
				</screenshot> 
			</figure>
			<para>To paint a cell, left-click on it; to unpaint it again, left-click on it again. When cells are painted such that none
			of the three rules are broken, the game will end and the board may no longer be manipulated.</para>
			<para>&app; also allows you to highlight cells for your own reference when solving a board. This can be achieved by holding
			<keycap>Ctrl</keycap> or <keycap>Shift</keycap> and clicking on a cell. They both highlight cells differently, and cells
			can be highlighted in both manners at the same time. Highlighted cells can be de-highlighted by clicking on them again while
			holding either <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> or <keycap>Shift</keycap>.</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="hitori-customization">
			<title>Customizing the Game</title>
			<para>The game can be customized by changing the board size &#8212; boards from 5&#8211;10 cells square are allowed.</para>
			<para>To change the board size, choose an option from
			<menuchoice> 
				<guimenu>Game</guimenu> 
				<guimenuitem>Board Size</guimenuitem> 
			</menuchoice>. &app; will ask if you want to stop the current game if you're in the middle of one, then start a new game
			with the requested board size.</para>
