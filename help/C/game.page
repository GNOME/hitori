	<title>Hitori the Game</title>

	<p>Hitori is a small logic puzzle in a similar vein to the more popular Sudoku. In the game, the player starts with a square board of numbers,
		and has to <em>paint out</em> cells until there are no duplicate numbers in each row and column. The following rules apply:</p>
	<list>
		<item><p>There must only be one of each number in the unpainted cells in each row and column.</p></item>
		<item><p>No painted cell may be adjacent to another, vertically or horizontally.</p></item>
		<item><p>All the unpainted cells must be joined together vertically and horizontally in one group.</p></item>
	</list>
	<p>These are the only three rules of the game, and so there may well be multiple solutions to a Hitori puzzle board.</p>
