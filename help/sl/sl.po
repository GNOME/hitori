msgid "Hitori is quite similar to Sudoku, in that it takes logical deduction to work out which cells to paint out. One strategy is to use <key>Shift</key>-clicking to highlight all the repeated numbers in each <em>column</em>, then use <key>Ctrl</key>-clicking to highlight all the repeated numbers in each <em>row</em>."

msgid "Once this is done for the entire board, the cells which have been highlighted both ways are good candidates for painting, although not always. When painting a cell, unhighlighting the other cells with the same number in the same row and column as that cell is a good way to keep track of which cells are still violating <link xref=\"game\">rule 1 of Hitori</link>."
